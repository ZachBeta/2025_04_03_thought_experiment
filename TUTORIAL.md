# PartyRecall Tutorial Flow

## Welcome Sequence
1. Initial Welcome
   ```
   System: Welcome to PartyRecall! I'm going to help you understand how AI memory works while we plan a party together.
   System: See the bar above? That shows how much I can remember at once.
   ```

2. Memory Bar Introduction
   ```
   System: Each message takes up some space in my memory:
   - Short messages [■__] take up a little space
   - Longer messages [■■■_] take up more space
   ```

## Party Planning Demo

### Stage 1: Basic Interaction
```
System: Let's start planning! What kind of party should we plan?
User: Let's plan a birthday party
System: Great choice! A birthday party it is. Notice how each message appears in the memory bar above?
```

### Stage 2: Building Context
```
System: Now let's add some details. Who is the birthday party for?
[User responds]
System: Perfect! As we add more details, watch how the memory fills up.
```

### Stage 3: Memory Limits
```
System: Let's list everything we've decided so far:
- Type: Birthday
- For: [Name]
- [Additional details...]

Notice how older messages start fading? That's because my memory is getting full!
```
